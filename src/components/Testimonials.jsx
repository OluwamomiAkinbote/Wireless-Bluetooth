It is a wonderful budget-friendly headset but could maybe use a bit of improvement on the range as it does not reach nearly as far as advertised.\n\nPros:\n- Battery Life\n- Recharging Case\n- Comfort\n- Sound Quality\n\nCons:\n- Range on Bluetooth",

      "I've had this one for several months now and it is doing great. It sounds great and there is plenty of volume. It is very lightweight, fits well, comfortable, and after a few minutes I forget that I have it on. The battery lasts as long as I'm wearing it. It automatically connects when removed from the charging box and disconnects when replaced. The charger box recharges multiple times, and the digital display shows the charge left. I'm very happy with this one.",

      "Way better than other cheaper ones I've had. Battery/talk-time is fantastically better. The voice that tells me it's connected is a bit foreign, I would have preferred a more 'local' one or if there were choices, but this is a super-minor complaint. It's very comfortable, I forget it's even on my ear. Overall, I am very pleased and hope it lasts a while â€“ it's only been used a few weeks thus far.",
